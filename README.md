# BankingApp
I have completed a personal project using Java and SQL servers to build a functional banking app with full front-end and back-end development. My app can log users in, register users that don't already have an account, deposit, withdraw, and transfer money between these users, and keep an array of the past transactions for each user to view including a date and timestamp for each transaction.
